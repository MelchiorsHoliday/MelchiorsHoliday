Hello, I am Miles. I'm developing my knowledge of programming and software engineering.
Aiming to get to the point where I can make and sell educational games.

I've loved working out how to customise and personalise computers, make them more efficient and tailored to my needs, and the needs of my friends and family. I started learning to code in order to build games, using GameMakerStudio to build simple platformers. I want to one day build educational games for children with additional needs, because many of the children I have taught love playing games, and learn so much from them. Since then, I have learnt the rudiments of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS through Codecademy. I have really enjoyed learning, and I am ready to take it to the next level, and move towards professional education and quality. Ultimately, I hope to end up working remotely, helping to build efficient systems that can make our machinery work better for us.

I am drawn to  community and peer-led learning; some of my fondest experiences of learning to code have been working on a project, and asking my flatmate for help with a specific issue. We would sit down, cramped on a tiny sofa in the living room, and work through an issue for hours, puzzling together and having a great time struggling! Eventually we would work it out, and those periods of collaboration and peer-learning were what showed me that I love coding. The opportunity to talk so intensively on a project, to work out between us what might be a solution - that's how I learn, and it's how I want to learn. I feel you make it very clear that this approach is at the heart of your practice, so I feel I it is the right place for me to train.

I've worked with special education needs children in primary schools for the last few years, specialising in autism.  I am patient and non-judgemental, and always work to make sure all members of a group are listened to and included. I usually act as a facilitator, and focus on keeping a discussion moving, and evenly distributed across group members. I like also to herd and shepard the team, initiating discussions, summarising points, and suggesting next steps. I'm good at remembering what people have said, and why they have said it.
