Hello, I am Miles. I'm developing my knowledge of programming and software engineering.
Aiming to get to the point where I can make and sell educational games.

I've loved working out how to customise and personalise computers, make them more efficient and tailored to my needs, and the needs of my friends and family. I started learning to code in order to build games, using GameMakerStudio to build simple platformers. I've worked with special education needs children in primary schools for the last few years, specialising in autism. I want to one day build educational games for children with additional needs, because many of the children I have taught love playing games, and learn so much from them. Since then, I have learnt the rudiments of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS through Codecademy. I have really enjoyed learning, and I am ready to take it to the next level, and move towards professional education and quality. Ultimately, I hope to end up working remotely, helping to build efficient systems that can make our machinery work better for us.
